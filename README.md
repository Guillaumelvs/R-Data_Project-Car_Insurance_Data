# R-Data_Project-Car_Insurance_Data
 Here is our R project (2022 - ISF master's degree Dauphine). Please find here our approach for importing data, pre-process them and let them talk through ML models. (Evaluation of this code by the R's lecturer : 20/20)
 
- You can read the "Description.pdf" file to have a brief idea of the subject.
- You will find all the R code in the "Code.Rmd" file.
- Datas are in csv files.
- And if you want a nice framework to visualize our approach please take a look to "Our Project.pdf"


Sorry in advance for not having set the "seed" ! Following this, on the pdf file, the hyperparameter "nrounds" (number of trees which have to be trained) in the XGboost approach is 5 rather than 19. 
Also, feel free to ask me if you want a translation of some french paragraph.
